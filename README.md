# Voya-Mutual-Fund-Monthly-Holdings
This is a python script designed to pull from Voya Mutual Fund Holdings for monthly tracking.

My initial mission with this was to setup a network of automated data pulls from the United States most popular, well performing Mutual Funds and ETFs. Myself and other friends work on additional projects in our free time so if you want to help build this network or know of another group doing something similar please message me.
