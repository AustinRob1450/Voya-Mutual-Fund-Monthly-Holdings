# Voya-Mutual-Fund-Monthly-Holdings
This is a python script designed to pull from Voya Mutual Fund Holdings for monthly tracking.

My initial mission with this was to setup a network of automated data pulls from the United States most popular, well perfomring Mutual Funds and ETFs. Myself and other friends work on additional projects in our free time so if you want to help build this network or know of another group doing something similar please message me.

Instructions are as follows:
1. Review the programs raw code for your security.
2. Set up the proper developement enviroment where you can test and run the code without exposing vulnerabilities.
3. Line 17, enter in a folder path that you established where you want to store the files you download. 
   Syntax for folder paths are as follows: r'Example/folder/for/storage/'
3. Rename the Master File if you so please
4. Linux: install python3 and run the appropriate commands from the command line
5. Windows: Idek man
6. MacOS: Dido linux

The associated program files are a mixture of my own and some other public works.
Feel free to contribute, offer suggestions, and use at free will.
